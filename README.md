# 🚀 Get Started

**This repo is where attendees go to continue their learning after your session — and your Copilot agent will help you set it up.**

### Step 1: Open your repo

Open this repo in a **Codespace** (click the green **Code** button → **Create a Codespace**) — or clone it locally. Then open **GitHub Copilot Chat**.

### Step 2: Add your content

Give the agent something to work with. Drag files into the Explorer panel — session abstracts, outlines, screenshots, notes — and drop them in one of two places:

| Where to put it | What goes there | Who sees it |
|---|---|---|
| **`_remove-before-publish/`** | Internal reference materials (abstracts, outlines, screenshots, planning docs) | **Copilot only** — never published |
| **`/docs/`, `/src/`, or repo root** | Lab instructions, demo code, sample data, getting-started guides | **Attendees** — published with the repo |

> 💡 Not sure? Start by dropping your session abstract or outline into `_remove-before-publish/`. The agent will figure out what to do with it.

### Step 3: Ask the Agent

Once your content is in the repo, use these three phrases with Copilot to build out your session repo:

| Phrase to use with Copilot | What it does | When to run it |
|---|---|---|
| **"Help me get started"** | Sets up session title, description, outcomes, and owners | After you've added your session abstract or outline to the repo |
| **"Help me refine content"** | Organizes your session content into the repo | Each time you add or update content |
| **"Help me finalize"** | Final review, cleanup, and publication prep | When you're ready to publish |

> 💡 **These three phrases are just the starting point.** Copilot can do much more — try asking it to brainstorm next steps for attendees, generate code samples, or build out your repo structure. Don't be afraid to put it in plan mode and ask for what you need.

## 🔥 DEM313: Building and Ship Production-Ready Apps Fast with Rayfin and Microsoft Fabric

### Session Description

See how to build and ship a production-ready field technician app using Rayfin and Microsoft Fabric. Walk through a real-world field technician scenario — adding authentication, data persistence with role-based access policies, job management, and customer tracking — then deploy to Fabric, all without managing backend infrastructure.

### 🚀 Getting started

To get started with this demo:
- Clone this repository
- Set up your development environment
- <!-- step 3 -->

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this demo, you will be able to:

- Scaffold a production-ready React app with Rayfin and deploy it to Microsoft Fabric
- Add authentication with dual sign-in support (local username/password and Fabric Entra)
- Define data entities with role-based access policies using Rayfin decorators
- Build a service layer for job management, customer tracking, and user profiles
- Use GitHub Copilot to add new features and debug issues in your app

### 💬 Keep Learning with Copilot

Try these prompts with GitHub Copilot to explore the topics from this demo. Open Copilot Chat in VS Code (`Ctrl+Alt+I` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+I` on Mac), paste a prompt, and see what you learn. Try connecting the [Microsoft Learn MCP Server](#-microsoft-learn-mcp-server) for the latest official documentation.

Use these as a starting point — or write your own!
